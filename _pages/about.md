I am an assistant professor in econometrics at the Department of Economics, Econometrics and Finance, University of Groningen. I got my PhD from Heinrich-Heine-University Düsseldorf, which was awarded with the [prize for the best dissertation at the Faculty of Business Administration and Economics in 2021 by the Kreissparkasse Düsseldorf](https://www.hhu.de/en/news-article/page?tx_news_pi1%5Bnews%5D=35660&cHash=a1027189334451aa2ca4f4cb22909f3f).

My research interest is at the intersection of econometrics and empirical industrial organization/quantitative marketing. More specifically, my research studies the nonparametric estimation of heterogeneous parameter discrete choice models. I am also interested in the application of machine learning methods in this context.
